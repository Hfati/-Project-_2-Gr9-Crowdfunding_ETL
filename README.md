# -Project-_2-Gr9-Crowdfunding_ETL
During the ETL mini project, we collaborate in a team of three individuals to get hands-on experience in constructing an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary techniques or regular expressions for data extraction and transformation. Once the data is transformed, we generate four CSV files. These CSV files are then used to develop an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a table schema. Ultimately, we were required to transfer the data from the CSV file into a Postgres database.
